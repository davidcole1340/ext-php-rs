# ext-php-rs

Bindings for the Zend API to build PHP extensions natively in Rust. Inspired by [killertux/solder](https://github.com/killertux/solder) and its predecessors.

## Features

This is not a set feature list, but these are the features on my roadmap. Create an issue if there's something you'd like to see!

- [x] Module definitions
- [x] Function implementation
- [x] Class implementation
    - [x] Class methods
    - [ ] Class properties
    - [x] Class constants
- [ ] Module constants
- [x] Calling PHP functions

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or later
     - No support is planned for lower versions.
- Rust - no idea which version

See the following links for the dependency crate requirements:

- [`cc`](https://github.com/alexcrichton/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)
- [`bindgen`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html)


## Usage

This project only works for PHP >= 8.0 (for now). Due to the fact that the PHP extension system relies heavily on C macros (which cannot be exported to Rust easily), structs have to be hard coded in.

See the [example project](example/skel). There is inline documentation. Starting by creating a C extension is a good start as well.

## Contributions

Contributions are very much welcome. I am a novice Rust developer and any suggestions are wanted and welcome. Feel free to file issues and PRs through Github.
