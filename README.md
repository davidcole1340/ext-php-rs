Bindings and abstractions for the Zend API to build PHP extensions natively in
Rust.

- Documentation: <https://docs.rs/ext-php-rs>
- Guide: <https://davidcole1340.github.io/ext-php-rs>

## Example

Export a simple function `function hello_world(string $name): string` to PHP:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(windows, feature(abi_vectorcall))]

use ext_php_rs::prelude::*;

/// Gives you a nice greeting!
/// 
/// @param string $name Your name.
/// 
/// @return string Nice greeting!
#[php_function]
pub fn hello_world(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

// Required to register the extension with PHP.
#[php_module]
pub fn module(module: ModuleBuilder) -> ModuleBuilder {
    module
}
```

Use [`cargo-php`] to build IDE stubs and install the extension:

```text
$ cargo install cargo-php
  Installing cargo-php v0.1.0
$ cargo php stubs --stdout
  Compiling example-ext v0.1.0
  Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3.57s
<?php

// Stubs for example-ext

/**
 * Gives you a nice greeting!
 *
 * @param string $name Your name.
 *
 * @return string Nice greeting!
 */
function hello_world(string $name): string {}
$ cargo php install --release
  Compiling example-ext v0.1.0
  Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1.68s
Are you sure you want to install the extension `example-ext`? yes
$ php -m
[PHP Modules]
// ...
example-ext
// ...
```

Calling the function from PHP:

```php
var_dump(hello_world("David")); // string(13) "Hello, David!"
```

For more examples read the library
[guide](https://davidcole1340.github.io/ext-php-rs).

[`cargo-php`]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-php

## Features

- **Easy to use:** The built-in macros can abstract away the need to interact
  with the Zend API, such as Rust-type function parameter abstracting away
  interacting with Zend values.
- **Lightweight:** You don't have to use the built-in helper macros. It's
  possible to write your own glue code around your own functions.
- **Extensible:** Implement `IntoZval` and `FromZval` for your own custom types,
  allowing the type to be used as function parameters and return types.

## Goals

Our main goal is to **make extension development easier.**

- Writing extensions in C can be tedious, and with the Zend APIs limited
  documentation can be intimidating.
- Rust's modern language features and feature-full standard library are big
  improvements on C.
- Abstracting away the raw Zend APIs allows extensions to be developed faster
  and with more confidence.
- Abstractions also allow us to support future (and potentially past) versions
  of PHP without significant changes to extension code.

## Documentation

The library guide can be read
[here](https://davidcole1340.github.io/ext-php-rs).

The project is documented in-line, so viewing the `cargo` documentation is the
best resource at the moment. This can be viewed at [docs.rs].

## Requirements

- Linux, macOS or Windows-based operating system.
- PHP 8.0 or later.
  - No support is planned for earlier versions of PHP.
- Rust.
  - Currently, we maintain no guarantee of a MSRV, however lib.rs suggests Rust
    1.57 at the time of writing.
- Clang 5.0 or later.

### Windows Requirements

- Extensions can only be compiled for PHP installations sourced from
  <https://windows.php.net>. Support is planned for other installations
  eventually.
- Rust nightly is required for Windows. This is due to the [vectorcall] calling
  convention being used by some PHP functions on Windows, which is only
  available as a nightly unstable feature in Rust.
- It is suggested to use the `rust-lld` linker to link your extension. The MSVC
  linker (`link.exe`) is supported however you may run into issues if the linker
  version is not supported by your PHP installation. You can use the `rust-lld`
  linker by creating a `.cargo\config.toml` file with the following content:
  ```toml
  # Replace target triple if you have a different architecture than x86_64
  [target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
  linker = "rust-lld"
  ```
- The `cc` crate requires `cl.exe` to be present on your system. This is usually
  bundled with Microsoft Visual Studio.
- `cargo-php`'s stub generation feature does not work on Windows. Rewriting this
  functionality to be cross-platform is on the roadmap.

## Cargo Features

All features are disabled by default.

- `closure` - Enables the ability to return Rust closures to PHP. Creates a new
  class type, `RustClosure`.
- `anyhow` - Implements `Into<PhpException>` for `anyhow::Error`, allowing you
  to return anyhow results from PHP functions. Supports anyhow v1.x.

## Usage

Check out one of the example projects:

- [anonaddy-sequoia](https://gitlab.com/willbrowning/anonaddy-sequoia) - Sequoia
  encryption PHP extension.
- [opus-php](https://github.com/davidcole1340/opus-php) - Audio encoder for the
  Opus codec in PHP.
- [tomlrs-php](https://github.com/jphenow/tomlrs-php) - TOML data format parser.
- [php-scrypt](https://github.com/appwrite/php-scrypt) - PHP wrapper for the
  scrypt password hashing algorithm.

## Contributions

Contributions are very much welcome. I am a novice Rust developer and any
suggestions are wanted and welcome. Feel free to file issues and PRs through
Github.

Contributions welcome include:

- Documentation expansion (examples in particular!)
- Safety reviews (especially if you have experience with Rust and the Zend API).
- Bug fixes and features.
- Feature requests.
