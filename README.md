Bindings and abstractions for the Zend API to build PHP extensions natively in
Rust.

## Example

Export a simple function `function hello_world(string $name): string` to PHP:

```rust
use ext_php_rs::prelude::*;

/// Gives you a nice greeting!
/// 
/// @param string $name Your name.
/// 
/// @return string Nice greeting!
#[php_function]
pub fn hello_world(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

// Required to register the extension with PHP.
#[php_module]
pub fn module(module: ModuleBuilder) -> ModuleBuilder {
    module
}
```

Use [`cargo-php`] to build IDE stubs and install the extension:

```text
$ cargo install cargo-php
  Installing cargo-php v0.1.0
$ cargo php stubs --stdout
  Compiling example-ext v0.1.0
  Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3.57s
<?php

// Stubs for example-ext

/**
 * Gives you a nice greeting!
 *
 * @param string $name Your name.
 *
 * @return string Nice greeting!
 */
function hello_world(string $name): string {}
$ cargo php install --release
  Compiling example-ext v0.1.0
  Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1.68s
Are you sure you want to install the extension `example-ext`? yes
$ php -m
[PHP Modules]
// ...
example-ext
// ...
```

Calling the function from PHP:

```php
var_dump(hello_world("David")); // string(13) "Hello, David!"
```

For more examples read the library
[guide](https://davidcole1340.github.io/ext-php-rs/guide).

[`cargo-php`]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-php

## Features

- **Easy to use:** The built-in macros can abstract away the need to interact
  with the Zend API, such as Rust-type function parameter abstracting away
  interacting with Zend values.
- **Lightweight:** You don't have to use the built-in helper macros. It's
  possible to write your own glue code around your own functions.
- **Extensible:** Implement `IntoZval` and `FromZval` for your own custom types,
  allowing the type to be used as function parameters and return types.

## Goals

Our main goal is to **make extension development easier.**

- Writing extensions in C can be tedious, and with the Zend APIs limited
  documentation can be intimidating.
- Rust's modern language features and feature-full standard library are big
  improvements on C.
- Abstracting away the raw Zend APIs allows extensions to be developed faster
  and with more confidence.
- Abstractions also allow us to support future (and potentially past) versions
  of PHP without significant changes to extension code.

## Documentation

The library guide can be read
[here](https://davidcole1340.github.io/ext-php-rs/guide).

The project is documented in-line, so viewing the `cargo` documentation is the
best resource at the moment. This can be viewed at [docs.rs].

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or later
  - No support is planned for lower versions.
- Linux or Darwin-based OS
- Rust - no idea which version
- Clang 3.9 or greater

See the following links for the dependency crate requirements:

- [`cc`](https://github.com/alexcrichton/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)
- [`bindgen`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html)

## Cargo Features

All features are disabled by default.

- `closure` - Enables the ability to return Rust closures to PHP. Creates a new
  class type, `RustClosure`.
- `anyhow` - Implements `Into<PhpException>` for `anyhow::Error`, allowing you
  to return anyhow results from PHP functions. Supports anyhow v1.x.

## Usage

This project only works for PHP >= 8.0 (for now). Due to the fact that the PHP
extension system relies heavily on C macros (which cannot be exported to Rust
easily), structs have to be hard coded in.

Check out one of the example projects:

- [anonaddy-sequoia](https://gitlab.com/willbrowning/anonaddy-sequoia) - Sequoia
  encryption PHP extension.
- [opus-php](https://github.com/davidcole1340/opus-php/tree/rewrite_rs) -
  Work-in-progress extension to use the Opus library in PHP.
