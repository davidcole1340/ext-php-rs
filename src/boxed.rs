//! A pointer type for heap allocation using the Zend memory manager.
//!
//! Heap memory in PHP is usually request-bound and allocated inside [memory
//! arenas], which are cleared at the start and end of a PHP request. Allocating
//! and freeing memory that is allocated on the Zend heap is done through two
//! separate functions [`efree`] and [`emalloc`].
//!
//! As such, most heap-allocated PHP types **cannot** be allocated on the stack,
//! such as [`ZendStr`], which is a dynamically-sized type, and therefore must
//! be allocated on the heap. A regular [`Box`] would not work in this case, as
//! the memory needs to be freed from a separate function `zend_string_release`.
//! The [`ZBox`] type provides a wrapper which calls the relevant release
//! functions based on the type and what is inside the implementation of
//! [`ZBoxable`].
//!
//! This type is not created directly, but rather through a function implemented
//! on the downstream type. For example, [`ZendStr`] has a function `new` which
//! returns a [`ZBox<ZendStr>`].
//!
//! [memory arenas]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management
//! [`ZendStr`]: crate::types::ZendStr
//! [`emalloc`]: super::alloc::efree
