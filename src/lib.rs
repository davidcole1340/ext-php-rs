///
/// The function can panic when called under a few circumstances:

///
/// This `extern` block imports the [`strpos`] function from PHP. Notice that
/// the string parameters can take either [`String`] or [`&str`], the optional
/// parameter `offset` is an [`Option<i64>`], and the return value is a [`Zval`]

/// block that is not tagged with this macro.
///

/// identifier in the format `_internal_php_#ident`.
///
/// Methods and constants are declared mostly the same as their global
/// counterparts, so read the documentation on the [`macro@php_function`] and
/// [`macro@php_const`] macros for more details.
///
/// The main difference is that the contents of the `impl` block *do not* need
/// to be tagged with additional attributes - this macro assumes that all
/// contents of the `impl` block are to be exported to PHP.
///
/// The only contrary to this is setting the visibility, optional argument and
/// default arguments for methods. These are done through separate macros:
///
/// - `#[defaults(key = value, ...)]` for setting defaults of method variables,
///   similar to the

///         b: "Hello, world!".into(),
///         c: "Static string",
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Can be used in PHP:
///
/// ```php
/// $obj = (object) [
///     'a' => 5,
///     'b' => 'Hello, world!',
///     'c' => 'asdf',
/// ];
/// take_object($obj);
/// var_dump(give_object());

/// ```
/// # #![cfg_attr(windows, feature(abi_vectorcall))]
/// # use ext_php_rs::prelude::*;

///
/// # Enums
///
/// When the macro is used on an enum, the [`FromZval`] and [`IntoZval`]
/// implementations will treat the enum as a tagged union with a mixed datatype.
/// This allows you to accept two different types in a parameter, for example, a
/// string and an integer.
///
/// The enum variants must not have named fields (i.e. not in the form of a
/// struct), and must have exactly one field, the type to extract from the
/// [`Zval`]. Optionally, the enum may have a single default, empty variant,
/// which is used when the [`Zval`] did not contain any data to fill
/// the other variants. This empty variant is equivalent to `null` in PHP.
///
/// The ordering of the enum variants is important, as the [`Zval`] contents is
/// matched in order of the variants. For example, [`Zval::string`] will attempt
/// to read a string from the [`Zval`], and if the [`Zval`] contains a long, the
/// long will be converted to a string. If a string variant was placed above an
/// integer variant in the enum, the integer would be converted into a
/// string and passed as the string variant.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Basic example showing the importance of variant ordering and default field:
///
/// ```
/// # #![cfg_attr(windows, feature(abi_vectorcall))]
/// # use ext_php_rs::prelude::*;
/// #[derive(Debug, ZvalConvert)]
/// pub enum UnionExample<'a> {
///     Long(u64), // Long
///     ProperStr(&'a str), // Actual string - not a converted value
///     ParsedStr(String), // Potentially parsed string, i.e. a double
///     None // Zval did not contain anything that could be parsed above
