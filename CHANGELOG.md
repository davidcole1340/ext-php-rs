## Version 0.7.1

- Ensure stable ABI between `cargo-php` and downstream extensions. [#108]
  - `ext-php-rs` versions used when compiling CLI and extension are now
    compared.

[#108]: https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs/pull/108

## Version 0.7.0

- Disabled serialization and unserialization of Rust structs exported as PHP
  classes. [#105]
  - You can't serialize an associated Rust struct so this would have never
    worked, but disabling them fixes crashes when running in an environment like
    psysh.
- Replaced boxed module inside `ModuleBuilder` with in-struct module.
- Fixed builds failing on Linux AArch64 systems. [#106]
- Added `cargo-php` for creating stubs, installing and uninstalling extensions.
  [#107]
  - Check out the guide for more information on this.

## Version 0.6.0

- Reorganized project. [#101]
  - Changed (almost all) module paths. Too many changes to list them all, check
    out the docs.
  - Removed `skel` project.
- Allow methods to accept references to `ZendClassObject<T>` instead of `self`.

## Version 0.5.3

- Fixed docs.rs PHP bindings file.

## Version 0.5.2

- Constructors that return `Self` can now be added to classes. [#83]
  - `Default` is no longer required to be implemented on classes, however, a
    constructor must be specified if you want to construct the class from PHP.
  - Constructors can return `Self` or `Result<Self, E>`, where
    `E: Into<PhpException>`.
- Added `FromZendObject` and `IntoZendObject` traits. [#74]
- Added `#[derive(ZvalConvert)]` derive macro. Derives `IntoZval` and `FromZval`
  on arbitrary structs and enums. [#78]
- Added `ZBox<T>`, similar to `Box<T>`, to allocate on the Zend heap. [#94]
- Changed execution data functions to take mutable references. [#100]
- `&mut T` is now valid as a function parameter. [#100]

## Version 0.5.0

### Breaking changes

- Method names are now renamed to snake case by default [#63].
- Refactored `ZendHashTable` into an owned and borrowed variant [#76].
  - Creating a new hashtable is done through the `OwnedHashTable` struct, which
    is then dereferenced to `&HashTable`, as `String` is to `&str`.
- Refactored `ZendString` into an owned and borrowed variant [#77].
  - Creating a new Zend string is done through the `ZendString` struct, which is
    then dereferenced to `&ZendStr`, as `String` is to `&str`.
- Class properties are now defined as struct properties, removing the old
  property system in the process [#69].

### Enhancements

- Added interfaces and parent class to the `Debug` implementation for
  `ClassEntry` [@72b0491].
- Rust unit type `()` now has a datatype of `void` [@8b3ed08].
- Functions returning Rust objects will now display their full classname in
  reflection [#64].
- Fixed alignment of class objects in memory [#66].

## Version 0.2.0 - 0.4.0

- Added macros!
- Missed a bit :(

## Version 0.1.0

- `Zval::reference()` returns a reference instead of a dereferenced pointer.
- Added `ZendHashTable::iter()` - note this is changing in a future version.
- `ClassBuilder::extends()` now takes a reference rather than a pointer to match
  the return type of `ClassEntry::exception()`.
- `ClassEntry::build()` now returns a reference - same reason as above.
- Improve library 'safety' by removing `unwrap` calls:
  - `.build()` returns `Result` on `FunctionBuilder`, `ClassBuilder` and
    `ModuleBuilder`.
  - `.property()` and `.constant()` return `Result` on `ClassBuilder`.
  - `.register_constant()` returns `Result`.
  - `.try_call()` on callables now return `Result` rather than `Option`.
  - `throw()` and `throw_with_code()` now returns `Result`.
  - `new()` and `new_interned()` on `ZendString` now returns a `Result`.
  - For `ZendHashTable`:
    - `insert()`, `insert_at_index()` now returns a
      `Result<HashTableInsertResult>`, where `Err` failed, `Ok(Ok)` inserts
      successfully without overwrite, and `Ok(OkWithOverwrite(&Zval))` inserts
      successfully with overwrite.
    - `push()` now returns a `Result`.
    - Converting from a `Vec` or `HashMap` to a `ZendHashTable` is fallible, so
      it now implements `TryFrom` as opposed to `From`.
  - For `Zval`:
    - `set_string()` now returns a `Result`, and takes a second parameter
      (persistent).
    - `set_persistent_string()` has now been removed in favour of
      `set_string()`.
    - `set_interned_string()` also returns a `Result`.
    - `set_array()` now only takes a `ZendHashTable`, you must convert your
      `Vec` or `HashMap` by calling `try_into()` and handling the error.
