            the command is called

        --manifest <MANIFEST>
            Path to the Cargo manifest of the extension. Defaults to the manifest in the directory
            the command is called

        --yes
            Bypasses the confirmation prompt

$ cargo php stubs --help
cargo-php-stubs

Generates stub PHP files for the extension.

These stub files can be used in IDEs to provide typehinting for extension classes, functions and
constants.

USAGE:
    cargo-php stubs [OPTIONS] [EXT]

ARGS:
    <EXT>
            Path to extension to generate stubs for. Defaults for searching the directory the
            executable is located in

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --manifest <MANIFEST>
            Path to the Cargo manifest of the extension. Defaults to the manifest in the directory
            the command is called.

            This cannot be provided alongside the `ext` option, as that option provides a direct
            path to the extension shared library.

    -o, --out <OUT>
            Path used to store generated stub file. Defaults to writing to `<ext-name>.stubs.php` in
            the current directory

        --stdout
            Print stubs to stdout rather than write to file. Cannot be used with `out`
